# Pitch Class Distributions in Turkish Classical Music

This repository contains code, plots, and data for the use of determining pitch class distributions in makam music.
The data used is from the [SymbTr dataset](https://github.com/MTG/SymbTr).
We used a copy of the MusicXML scores from that dataset and saved in the MusicMXL directory of this repository.
Plots of the results can be found in the plots directory.
The corresponding academic paper for this work can be found in the file pitch-class-distributions-paper.pdf
The expirement can be replicated using the pitch-distributions.ipynb notebook.
